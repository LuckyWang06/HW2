First, it's shorter since all the unnecessary codes are deleted, every step left is the key step to make the game work. In this way, I can understand the function of each step easily. The name of variables reveals the meaning more clearly after the improvement, which make me feel easier to understand what the variable name represent as part of the game."

At the same time, it will also list important variables in the code and give explanation on it, so that students can clearly understand what each variable represents.\n",

Complex code such as \"nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)\" is hard for it to give a clear explanation. Therefore, I think chatbot is a good tool for beginners to learn coding. But with people who have basic knowledages of coding, it's not that helpful."

First, it understands the code in fast speed and is able to explain the usage of every line clearly, which allows students to get familiar with codes quicly. Also, due to its access to huge amounts of data, it can train itself by analyzing the massive data, which can improve its accuracies and speed. Therefore, I believe AI is a good tool for learners of coding, statistics, and data science."

There are also some skills that are important for all kinds of job, such as communication, problem solving, research and critical thinking. In order to acquire these skills, I need to be independent mentally and physically, communicate with multiple parties by myself when I face problems. Also, I should express yourself in your favorite field. At the same time, I also need to cultivate my own innovative thinking skills by always think about whether there are more diverse ways to solve things.\n",
